<h2>Big O Notation</h2>

<h3>Timing code issues:</h3>

1.  Different machines will record different times.
2.  The same machine will record different times.
3.  For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough.

<h3>The solution:</h3> 
- Count the number of simple operations required.
- addUpTo(n) => n \* (n + 1) / 2 => has three operations
- addUpToN(n) => 5n + 1
